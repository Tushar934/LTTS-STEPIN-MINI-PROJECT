<h2>Introduction </h2>
A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. A smartphone or other computer can also act as a calculator.
<br></br>
Some calculators, like the abacus, will work without electricity. Others, like the electronic calculator, use batteries. Some calculators are simple, and can only add, subtract, multiply and divide, and sometimes take square roots. Scientific calculators can do many other things, such as use exponents (or powers or indices) and trigonometry functions.  
<h2>Benefits </h2>
Using a calculator in classes can help students save a whole lot of computational time on basic arithmetical calculations. This makes it easier for them to stress more on important math concepts rather than stressing more on basic arithmetical calculations.
<h2> Features </h2>
Calculate basic functions 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Logarithms
Sine, cosine, and tangent functions.
<h2> State of Art </h2>

<h2> Identify Requirements </h2>
The calculator has the following keys: 0..9, +, -, *, /, =,sqrt and many more. 
In any situation the calculator has to produce a correct result defined by the well known
arithmetic rules. 
<br></br>
If the calculations is impossible the calculator has to display information helping
the user to resolve the erroneous situation, like:
<br></br>
• On encountering a division by 0 the display should read "Cannot divide by 0" and typing the
key “C” should reset the calculator.<br></br>
• On calculating the square root value of a negative operand the display should read "Wrong
operand".

<h3> What </h3>
Many calculations need some application for faster calculation because manual calculations takes time but through application got fast output.
<h3> Where </h3>
The areas in which the calculator needs in Accounts for fast output and for long calculations as well as for students whose need for performing trignometric calculations and long calculations and apart from that areas there are some more areas in which calculator is useful.
<h3> When </h3>
Since the calculator application was not formed.
<h3> Who </h3>
The normal people facing problems in daily life.
<br></br>
<h3> How</h3>

<h2> SWOT Analysis</h2>
<h3> Strenghts </h3>
   This application is a user friendly application which performs all the mathematical operations.
<h3> Weaknesses </h3>
   This application is not implemented with user interface.
<h3> Oportunities </h3>
   This application wil be upgraded to user interface application.
<h3> Threats </h3>
   There are various similar appliaction for calculator which implements these advanced features.
